# covired - Janata Pass
As Curfew progresses, it becomes harder to control for 21 days. So an App was mooted which will keep Common man first in mind (Service workers, Volunteers , Police are also core users, but they have ID cards, and now physical passes -if executed well by govts).

- We respect privacy and keeping tracking etc to a minimum. Aiming solely for lightening the Roads unlike apps 4 patient tracking etc 
- We came together on 24 night when the PM announced , and realising the enormity of the initiative and believing that it will work only  if we all pitch in.  The Core assumption of the APP is this :   If people have a way to self-declare to all before stepping out,they will auto-police and reduce outings to a minimum.       H
- How it plays out is detailed in the Concept note.  
    - Everyone gets a QR code (black n white). 
    - Under certain conditions it turns Green, Yellow or Pink.  
    - It enables people with passes to pass by just flashing their phones if their App is Coloured.    

**Who are we:**
